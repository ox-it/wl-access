  <h1>Access to the requested resource is forbidden</h1>

<p>You do not have permission to view the requested resource.</p>
<p>This could be for one of a number of reasons.</p>

<h2>Either, you need to login</h2>

<p>There are two ways to login to the system. Both links are found at the top of the page (on the right):</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Oxford Account</em> - this is for users who are registered with The University of Oxford. Clicking on this link will log you in to WebLearn via Oxford's single sign-on system. If you are currently not authenticated then you will be asked for your username and password, otherwise you will be presented with a confirmation page. Follow the instructions to gain access to WebLearn </li>
    <li><em>Other Users</em> - this is for users who are <em>not</em> registered with The University of Oxford but who have a special account within WebLearn. Enter your WebLearn username and password at the prompt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Or, you have not been given permission to access it</h2>

<p>You may need to contact the site owner and ask for access.</p>

<p>If you know which site the resource is a part of then click on the <em>Site Info</em> link in the Tools Menu on the left-hand side of the page. You should see the site owner's name and a corresponding email address; contact them and ask for access.</p>

<p>If you do not know which site the resource belongs to then ask the person who told you about the link.</p>

<h2>Or, the resource is not yet available or has become unavailable</h2>

<p>It is possible to restrict resources to only be available between certain dates, it may be that you are either too early or too late to see the resource.

<h2>Or, the address is incorrect</h2>

<p>Check your typing!</p>

<p> Have you been sent the wrong address? Perhaps you should confirm with the person that sent you the link that they havent made a mistake? </p>
